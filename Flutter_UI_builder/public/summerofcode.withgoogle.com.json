SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.","tech_tags":["python","cython"],"topic_tags":["mathematics","education","research"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/sage-gsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://twitter.com/sagemath"},{"name":"email","value":"tcscrims@gmail.com"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://sagemath.zulipchat.com/"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/sagemath"}],"source_code":"https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/","ideas_link":"https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/2024","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/sage-gsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://twitter.com/sagemath"},{"name":"email","value":"tcscrims@gmail.com"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://sagemath.zulipchat.com/"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/sagemath"}]},{"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/python-software-foundation/2vpxhpvcsvgyx3kg-360.png","website_url":"https://python-gsoc.org/","tagline":"A programming language used for science & more","license":"Python-2.0","categories":["Science and medicine","Programming languages"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://python-gsoc.org/index.html#gettingstarted","description":"Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.\n\nThe Python Software Foundation serves as an umbrella organization to a\nvariety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the\ndevelopment of the Python language.\n\nYou can view a full list of participating sub-orgs here:\nhttps://python-gsoc.org/ideas.html\n\nSub-orgs:\n- Borg Collective - backup tools\n- CVE Binary Tool - scanning for known security vulnerabilities\n- DIPY - 3d/4d+ imaging\n- Fury - scientific visualization tools\n- LPython - ahead of time compiler for python\n- MNE-Python - tools for human neurophysiological data\n- Mission Support System - atmospheric science tools for flight planning\n- PyData/Sparse - n-dimensional sparse arrays for pyData\n- PyElastica - simulation and modeling for slender structures","tech_tags":["python","javascript","c++","SBOM"],"topic_tags":["security","visualization","compiler","modeling","Backup"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://python-gsoc.org/index.html#contact"},{"name":"blog","value":"https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/"}],"source_code":"https://python-gsoc.org/ideas.html","ideas_link":"https://python-gsoc.org/ideas.html","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://python-gsoc.org/index.html#contact"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"blog","value":"https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/"}]},{"name":"The Linux Foundation","slug":"the-linux-foundation","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/the-linux-foundation/ydeu9rliawhe6of9-360.png","website_url":"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/","tagline":"Non-profit consortium fostering growth of Linux","license":"MIT","categories":["Operating systems"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2024","description":"The Linux Foundation is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.

One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration.","tech_tags":["python","c++","r","jupyter","github-actions"],"topic_tags":["mathematics","data science","computational biology","computational geometry","statistics"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/geomscale-gsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://gitter.im/GeomScale/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link"},{"name":"email","value":"geomscale@gmail.com"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://mobile.twitter.com/GeomScale"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/GeomScale","ideas_link":"https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc24/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/geomscale-gsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://gitter.im/GeomScale/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link"},{"name":"email","value":"geomscale@gmail.com"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://mobile.twitter.com/GeomScale"}]},{"name":"Creative Commons","slug":"creative-commons","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/creative-commons/jvj0y3czaagpnhvz-360.png","website_url":"https://opensource.creativecommons.org/","tagline":"Nonprofit building a global digital commons.","license":"MIT","categories":["Web","Other"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://opensource.creativecommons.org/programs/applicant-guide/","description":"Creative Commons (CC) is a United States-based nonprofit 501(c)3 organization that provides open content copyright licenses, public domain tools, and resources on copyright and information literacy in the digital age.

It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face! \nThis year also we’ll allow the use of Cloud-based services, like Google’s models Gemini and Palm2.","tech_tags":["linux","android","nodejs","flutter","Google Earth"],"topic_tags":["visualization","artificial intelligence","networking","maps","ux"],"contact_links":[{"name":"email","value":"liquidgalaxylab@gmail.com"},{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://discord.gg/peGA5K8tJU"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/_liquidgalaxy"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/","ideas_link":"https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2023/09/google-summer-of-code-2024-unique-post.html#Project-Ideas","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"email","value":"liquidgalaxylab@gmail.com"},{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://discord.gg/peGA5K8tJU"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/_liquidgalaxy"}]},{"name":"Open Chemistry","slug":"open-chemistry","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/open-chemistry/esda0gvsxomll6my-360.png","website_url":"https://openchemistry.org/","tagline":"Advancing Open Source & Open Science for Chemistry","license":"BSD-3-Clause","categories":["Science and medicine","End user applications"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://wiki.openchemistry.org/Applying_to_GSoC","description":"The Open Chemistry project is a collection of open source, cross platform libraries and applications for the exploration, analysis and generation of chemical data.

Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.\n\nMoreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows combining different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.\n\nPolypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language.

As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.","tech_tags":["android","java","distributed systems","jvm"],"topic_tags":["model checking","symbolic execution","verification of concurrent systems","program analysis","test input generation"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/java-pathfinder"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/Java_Pathfinder"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core","ideas_link":"https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/java-pathfinder"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/Java_Pathfinder"}]},{"name":"Eclipse Foundation","slug":"eclipse-foundation","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/eclipse-foundation/q8mq4ucangxai7zi-360.png","website_url":"https://www.eclipse.org/","tagline":"The Global Open Source Foundation","license":"EPL-2.0","categories":["Programming languages","Infrastructure and cloud"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/gsoc-at-the-ef/-/blob/main/README.md","description":"The Eclipse Foundation provides our global community of individuals & organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for OSS collaboration and innovation.\n\nEclipse is an open source community that's focused around key principles of transparency, openness, and vendor neutrality: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest; project teams welcome new ideas, and invites others to participate;  and vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code.

It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n\n\nWhat is Lua?\n\n\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\nWhat is Lunatik?\n\nLunatik is an extension framework for Linux that combines the approaches of Extensible Operating Systems and Scripting Languages. This approach, named Kernel Scripting, advocates that OS kernels can be dynamically extended by using a high-level scripting language. Lunatik is a programming and execution environment that offers two main features: it allows developers to make subsystems scriptable and allows users to run Lua scripts in the kernel.\n\nWhat is Pallene?\n\nPallene is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua. It is designed to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types. Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.","tech_tags":["linux","lua","céu","pallene"],"topic_tags":["compilers","scripting languages","kernel scripting","statically-typed languages"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/labluagsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://matrix.to/#/#lablua:matrix.org"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/labluapucrio"}],"source_code":"http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/projects.html","ideas_link":"http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2024.html","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://groups.google.com/g/labluagsoc"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://matrix.to/#/#lablua:matrix.org"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/labluapucrio"}]},{"name":"freifunk","slug":"freifunk","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/freifunk/bpcbaeecusvfzbzk-360.png","website_url":"https://freifunk.net/en","tagline":"Free and open wireless networks","license":"GPL-3.0","categories":["Operating systems","Infrastructure and cloud"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://projects.freifunk.net/#/faq","description":"We unite wireless communities accross Europe like Freifunk, Ninux, qaul.net, Guifi.net, and Evernet e.G.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\nOverview\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\n\nWhat makes webpack unique?\nExtensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\n\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\n\nUsed at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\nCommunity Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders.

It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays.

This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.","tech_tags":["r","docker","api","geospatial"],"topic_tags":["data science","ecosystem models","scientific visualization","climate science","Ecological Forecasting,"],"contact_links":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://join.slack.com/t/pecanproject/shared_invite/enQtMzkyODUyMjQyNTgzLWEzOTM1ZjhmYWUxNzYwYzkxMWVlODAyZWQwYjliYzA0MDA0MjE4YmMyOTFhMjYyMjYzN2FjODE4N2Y4YWFhZmQ"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/PEcAnProject"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/pecanproject/pecan","ideas_link":"https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://join.slack.com/t/pecanproject/shared_invite/enQtMzkyODUyMjQyNTgzLWEzOTM1ZjhmYWUxNzYwYzkxMWVlODAyZWQwYjliYzA0MDA0MjE4YmMyOTFhMjYyMjYzN2FjODE4N2Y4YWFhZmQ"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/PEcAnProject"}]},{"name":"checkstyle","slug":"checkstyle","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/checkstyle/e8ubktvaft8eljli-360.png","website_url":"https://checkstyle.org","tagline":"Helps to adheres of Java coding standard","license":"LGPL-2.1","categories":["Programming languages","Development tools"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/To-GSoC-participant","description":"Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that is easy to read and adheres to a coding standard.

The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions.

R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.\n\nR is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tech_tags":["c","javascript","c++","r-project","fortran"],"topic_tags":["visualization","machine learning","data science","graphics","statistics"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com"},{"name":"email","value":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com"}],"source_code":"https://cran.r-project.org/","ideas_link":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2024/wiki/table%20of%20proposed%20coding%20projects","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com"},{"name":"email","value":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com"}],"social_comm_methods":[]},{"name":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University","slug":"department-of-biomedical-informatics-emory-university","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/department-of-biomedical-informatics-emory-university/l9jrm7pdhwnkxh3b-360.png","website_url":"https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/","tagline":"Biomedical research to advance healthcare","license":"BSD-3-Clause","categories":["Science and medicine","Artificial Intelligence"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://github.com/NISYSLAB/Emory-BMI-GSoC/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDANCE.md","description":"Biomedical Informatics is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data.

ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.\n\nUsers write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.\n\nThe compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.\n\nTo really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.","tech_tags":["opengl","c++","qt5","recursive-descent"],"topic_tags":["graphics","game development","compiler","programming","game design"],"contact_links":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://discord.gg/XTzB43C"},{"name":"email","value":"enigma-team@googlegroups.com"},{"name":"blog","value":"https://enigma-dev.org"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev","ideas_link":"https://enigma-dev.org/tracker/gsoc.php","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://discord.gg/XTzB43C"},{"name":"email","value":"enigma-team@googlegroups.com"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"blog","value":"https://enigma-dev.org"}]},{"name":"Ste||ar group","slug":"stear-group","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/stear-group/sebxbtinyakvrevb-360.png","website_url":"http://stellar-group.org/","tagline":"Shaping a Scalable Future","license":"BSL-1.0","categories":["Science and medicine","Programming languages"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-Submission-Template","description":"The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.

If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language.

We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed.\n\nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\n\nSince 2019 we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also felt these organizations often faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.\n\nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.","tech_tags":["python","java","c++"],"topic_tags":["office suite","desktop application","end user application"],"contact_links":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/IRC"},{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Mailing_List"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice"}],"source_code":"https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/source-code/","ideas_link":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GSoC/Ideas","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"chat","value":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/IRC"},{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Mailing_List"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice"}]},{"name":"sktime","slug":"sktime","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/sktime/x2i3dxljtj04sqw0-360.png","website_url":"https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/","tagline":"A unified framework for ML with time series","license":"BSD-3-Clause","categories":["Data","Artificial Intelligence"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved.html","description":"sktime provides an easy-to-use, flexible and modular open-source framework for a wide range of time series machine learning tasks.

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.","tech_tags":["python","c++","qt","simd"],"topic_tags":["real-time","dsp","communications engineering","cybersecurity","Software-Defined Radio"],"contact_links":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://chat.gnuradio.org/#/welcome"},{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/gnuradio"},{"name":"blog","value":"https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/"}],"source_code":"https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio","ideas_link":"https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoCIdeas","direct_comm_methods":[{"name":"mailingList","value":"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio"},{"name":"chat","value":"https://chat.gnuradio.org/#/welcome"}],"social_comm_methods":[{"name":"twitter","value":"https://twitter.com/gnuradio"},{"name":"blog","value":"https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/"}]},{"name":"Blender Foundation","slug":"blender-foundation","logo_url":"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/blender-foundation/vdfgx9yyygdjjvym-360.png","website_url":"https://www.blender.org","tagline":"The Freedom to Create","license":"GPL-2.0","categories":["End user applications","Media"],"contributor_guidance_url":"https://developer.blender.org/docs/programs/gsoc/","description":"Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suite, providing individuals and small teams a complete pipeline for 3D graphics, modeling, animation and games.\n\nBlender is being made by 100s of active volunteers from all around the world; by studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists, scientists and students, vfx experts and animators, and so on.

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation.\n\n    (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. \n\nAs a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them.
